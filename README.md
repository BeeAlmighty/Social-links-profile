## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned the importance of creating mobile-first designs because most of the web's traffic has been from smaller devices like mobile phones.
- I also learnt how to implement mobile-first workflow.
- I learnt proper CSS naming conventions with the help of BEM for easier code readability and reuseability.


### Continued development

I want to delve further into the world of naming convention with BEM and generally write proper and neat code to aid readability.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCode Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This site helped me understand CSS media queries and how to implement mobile-first workflow in detail.
- [BEM](https://www.getbem.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS naming conventions. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
